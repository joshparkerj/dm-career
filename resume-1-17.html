		  I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam I Am. I do 
		  not like them in a box. I do not like them with a fox. I do not like 
		  them with a bear. I do not like them in my hair. I do not like them 
		  in a house. I do not like them with a house. I do not like them in a 
		  dish. I do not like them with a fish. They are not good with mac and 
		  cheese. They're worse than getting stung by bees! These eggs are green
		  and that's not right. This ham gets worse with every bite. Green eggs 
		  and ham are not ok. I blame you, Sam, so go away.
